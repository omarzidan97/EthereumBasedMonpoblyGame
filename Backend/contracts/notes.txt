Blockchain Monopoly
Monopoly Guidelines

    8 players (Battleship, Boot, Scottie, Iron, Racecar, Hat, Thimble, Wheelbarrow)
    Total money in circulation: $15140
    Each player receives $1500 before round one
    Bank owns all the property at the start, players buy property from the bank
    Bank owns all the money at the start of the game
    The bank pays each player $200 everytime they pass Start
    Fines gets paid in a Fines Pool and is not owned by anybody
    Claiming the money in the Fines Pool needs another player / all the player's consensus
    Players pay 'Rent' to each other when landing on an owned property

To simplify the game, the token owner controls the bank. This can be a player or an external party. A more better solution would be to remove the bank owner with claims against the bank which gets approved by the other players.
Application "design"
The Contracts

The application will be split up into multiple contracts, it is neccesary for this use case, but it is fun.

contract Owned {
  /*
    This contract will be used to assign an owner to other cotracts
    and make the execution of certain functions privileged
  */
}

contract Bank {
  /*
    This will function much the same as the Owned contract, but can have a different
    controlling address assigned to it. It will also have a 'bank balance' 
  */
}

contract MonopolyGame {
  /*
    This a contract that creates contracts. When ever someone other than the contract 
    owner wants to play monopoly, they can run this contract and they will get their own "instance"
    of monopoly. This can be compared to buying a copy of a game.
  */
}

contract MonopolyBank is Owned, Bank {
  /*
    The actual monopoly game bank.
    MonopolyBank will be derived from Bank and Owned and will have access to their funtions
  */
}

Modifiers

A modifier are a special type of function that can be called before the function is executed and modify the behaviour of the function, we will build 3 modifiers:
